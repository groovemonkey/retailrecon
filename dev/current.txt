# RetailRecon (Ruby version)

WEIRDNESS:
-items returned:
	-117 on first run of get_all_products.rb,
	-245 on second run
-custom palette doesn't work yet (eye shadows)


TODO:
-write result list to file in get_all_products.rb
-compare existing list to previous list in get_all_products.rb ( http://mallibone.wordpress.com/2011/02/18/compare-listsarrays-in-ruby/ )

-could this be faster if I just got the whole DOM by clicking through everything (like in get_all_products.rb) and then parsed it locally? Instead of doing the webdriver thing the whole time and taking 4 minutes to get through all the bullshit.
	-getting all products into categories, YES
	-getting availability, NO



-should we build an information structure on our end? Categories, etc? Then scrape the old way (hidden vs visible, step by step instead of all at once)
-what kind of questions do we want to ask the data?
-right now, we can say "new product!" -- that's it. Then we'd have to search the site for the product and scrape collection name, product category, etc. from there. Seems OK to me.

-how do we see what's changed? Comparing sorted lists to find the difference?r



## Info:
+ phantomjs takes ~7 secs to get all MAC product names (single-level array), firefox takes ~55

1st lvl cat 	2nd lvl cat 	3rd lvl cat
Makeup			Eyes			Shadow,...

+ no need to manually click through to 3rd level categories and the products below.
+ when a 2nd lvl cat is clicked, all products for that cat are loaded, existing products are hidden but stay in DOM.
+ therefore, clicking each 2nd lvl cat and then grabbing all products (hidden and visible) WORKS
