# RetailRecon (Ruby version)

## Info:
+ phantomjs takes ~7 secs to get all MAC product names, firefox takes ~55

1st lvl cat 	2nd lvl cat 	3rd lvl cat
Makeup			Eyes			Shadow,...

+ no need to manually click through to 3rd level categories and the products below.
+ when a 2nd lvl cat is clicked, all products for that cat are loaded, existing products are hidden but stay in DOM.
+ therefore, clicking each 2nd lvl cat and then grabbing all products (hidden and visible) WORKS
